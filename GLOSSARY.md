## Apprenticeship Concepts & Terminology

### Apprenticeship Program Types
There are two types of apprenticeship programs available. Each program enhances your apprenticeship with high-quality standards, rigor, and additional benefits. 
##### Registered Apprenticeship Programs
A [Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP)](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/employers/registered-apprenticeship-program) is a proven model of apprenticeship that has been validated by the Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Agency.
##### Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs
[Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAP)](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/employers/industry-recognized-apprenticeship-program) are high-quality apprenticeship programs recognized as such by Standards Recognition Entity (SRE) pursuant to the DOL's standards.

### Apprenticeship Approach Types
##### Competency-Based Approach
Measures skill acquisition through the individual apprentice’s successful demonstration of acquired skills and knowledge, as verified by the program sponsor. Programs utilizing this approach must still require apprentices to complete an on-the-job learning component of Registered Apprenticeship. The program standards must address how on-the-job learning will be integrated into the program, describe competencies, and identify an appropriate means of testing and evaluation for such competencies.
##### Hybrid Approach
Measures the individual apprentice’s skill acquisition through a combination of specified minimum number of hours of on-the-job learning and the successful demonstration of competency as described in a work process schedule.
##### Time-Based Approach
Measures skill acquisition through the individual apprentice’s completion of at least 2,000 hours of on-the-job learning as described in a work process schedule.

### Apprenticeship Partner Types
##### American Job Centers
American Job Centers are resource centers where job seekers can get employment information, find out about career development training opportunities, and connect to various employment opportunities in their area.
##### Apprenticeship Offices
National, regional, and state apprenticeship offices and agencies provide technical assistance and support to program sponsors, answer questions about the apprenticeship model, guide partners on each phase of developing a program, connect businesses to training providers, and advise partners on available funding sources to support apprenticeships.
##### Educators
An educator can refer to an institution such as a 4-year college, community college, occupational school, and career and technical school. The educator delivers academic and skills instruction driven by industry standards (e.g., instructors, curriculum, instructional equipment). In an apprenticeship, the education and training provider can grant progressive credentials based on competency testing, facilitate access to financial aid and other support resources (e.g., student loans, tutoring, counseling), or use marketing and outreach channels to identify potential apprentices.
##### Industry and Equity Intermediaries
An apprenticeship intermediary is an organization with the capacity, expertise, and network to help businesses successfully create, launch, and expand apprenticeship programs. Intermediaries could be any of the following: Industry Associations and Business Organizations, Community and Technical Colleges, Non-Profit and Community-Based Organizations, Labor Management Partnerships, or Workforce Development Boards.
##### Sponsors
Any person, association, committee, or organization that operates a Registered Apprenticeship Program. This entity assumes the full responsibility for administration and operation of the apprenticeship program. Sponsors can be a single business or a consortium of businesses. Alternatively, the sponsor can be a workforce intermediary, such as an industry association or a labor-management organization. Community colleges and community-based organizations can also serve as sponsors of apprenticeship programs.
##### Standards Recognition Entity
A Standards Recognition Entity (SRE) is a third-party entity, recognized by the Department as qualified to evaluate, recognize, and oversee Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs) consistent with DOL’s standards. Connect with an SRE if you are looking for an innovative, flexible, industry-driven approach to administering an apprenticeship program that is recognized by a leader in your industry or occupation.
##### Workforce Development Boards
Workforce Development Boards direct federal, state, and local funding to workforce development programs. They help employers meet their needs for skilled workers and help career seekers find career and economic advancement.

### Apprenticeship Program Components
All registered apprenticeship programs consist of five core components:
##### Direct Business Involvement
Employers are the foundation of every apprenticeship program and the skills needed by their workforce are at the core. You will play an active role in building the program and be involved in every step of designing and implementing the apprenticeship program.
##### Related Instruction
Apprentices receive related instruction that complements OJT. The instruction delivers the technical and academic competencies that apply to the job, and can be provided by a community college, a technical school, an apprenticeship training school — or by the business itself. It can be provided at the school, online, or at the job site. Education partners often collaborate with business to develop the curriculum based on the skills and knowledge needed for the job.
##### On-The-Job Training
Every program includes structured on-the-job training (OJT). Apprentices get hands on training from an experienced mentor at the job site for a minimum of one year. While employers provide the mentors and identify the skills and knowledge to be learned through OJT, partners can support the employer in developing the approach to OJT and identifying resources to support this component.
##### Rewards for Skill Gains
Apprentices receive an increase in pay as their skills and knowledge increase. Employers start by establishing an entry wage and an ending wage, and build in progressive wage increases throughout the apprenticeship as skill benchmarks are met by the apprentices. Progressive wage increases help reward and motivate apprentices as they advance through their training.
##### National Occupational Credential
Every graduate of a Registered Apprenticeship program receives a nationally-recognized credential upon demonstrated mastery of every skill and have all the knowledge needed to be fully proficient for the specific occupation.
