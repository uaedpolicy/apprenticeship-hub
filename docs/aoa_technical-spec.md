## Data Notes 
### Lower Living Standard Income Level Guidelines
The Lower Living Standard Income Level (LLSIL) reflects cost of living increases for the Regions and major metro areas by calculating the percentage change in the most recent Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for an area then applying this calculation to each of the previous year's LLSIL figures.

The USDOL/ETAâ€™s [LLSIL Guidelines](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/llsil) include income charts that are used by state and local workforce investment areas to determine income eligibility for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs for youth and certain adult services, in addition to the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.
