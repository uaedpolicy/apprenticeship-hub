### Geographic Relationships

ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
: ZCTAs are based on the U.S. Postal Services ZIP Codes and must fall within the national boundary only. Many data users think that ZCTAs must stay within the state boundary, but in a few cases, ZCTAs can cross into bordering states.

School Districts
: School districts must fall within each state. States are responsible for updating their boundaries, and districts may cross county and place boundaries.

County Subdivisions
: County subdivisions, as the name suggests, must fall within the county. Many county subdivision names repeat throughout the nation and throughout the same state, so it is important you know which county you are working in. For example, in 2010, Beaver was used as the name of 45 different county subdivisions.

Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) 
: Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) (metropolitan/micropolitan statistical areas) fall within the nation and often cross state lines.

## Data Notes 
### Lower Living Standard Income Level Guidelines
The Lower Living Standard Income Level (LLSIL) reflects cost of living increases for the Regions and major metro areas by calculating the percentage change in the most recent Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for an area then applying this calculation to each of the previous year's LLSIL figures.

The USDOL/ETAâ€™s [LLSIL Guidelines](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/llsil) include income charts that are used by state and local workforce investment areas to determine income eligibility for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs for youth and certain adult services, in addition to the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.
