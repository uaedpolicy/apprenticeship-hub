## Classifications 
The information stored in the Alabama Workforce Information Database (ALWID) contains many different classification systems for occupations (DOT, SOC, OES, ONET, etc.), industries (NAICS and SIC) and training programs (various releases of CIP).

### Occupation Classifications
#### Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)
The [Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)](https://www.bls.gov/soc/) system is a federal statistical standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories.  The 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system is a [federal statistical standard](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/statistical-programs-standards/) used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data. All workers are classified into one of 867 detailed occupations according to their occupational definition. To facilitate classification, detailed occupations are combined to form 459 broad occupations, 98 minor groups, and 23 major groups. Detailed occupations in the SOC with similar job duties, and in some cases skills, education, and/or training, are grouped together. 
#### ONET-SOC Taxonomy
Based on the Standard Occupational Classification external site, the ONET-SOC taxonomy currently includes 923 occupations which currently have, or are scheduled to have, data collected from job incumbents or occupation experts.  The most recent version is ONET-SOC 2019. Note: in-demand occupations are classified according to SOC 2010 codes, and have been crosswalked to the ONET-SOC 2019 taxonomy. As a result, multiple ONET-SOC codes can be associated with a single SOC 2010 code, and vice-versa. 

### Industry Classifications
#### North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by federal agencies for classifying businesses for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing data related to the U.S. economy.
#### Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 
A four-digit code that categorizes the industries that companies belong to based on their business activities. 


### Training Program Classifications
#### Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)
The [Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/resources.aspx?y=56) is the National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) primary classification for instructional programs. It provides a taxonomic scheme that supports the accurate tracking and reporting of fields of study and program completions activity. CIP codes serve as the national taxonomic standard of academic program titles for federal surveys and state reporting of institutional data.  Additionally, CIP codes are crosswalked with SOC occupation codes to analyze educational outcomes, wage premiums, and workforce supply and demand.  Job banks use them to match qualifications with job postings and labor market data. CIP was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020.

### Other Classifications
#### Registered Apprenticeship Partnership Information Data System (RAPIDS)
A Federal system that provides for the automated collection, retention, updating, retrieval, and summarization of information related to apprentices and apprenticeship programs.

## Data Sources
#### Occupational Information Network (O*NET)
An online database containing occupational information, such as personal requirements and characteristics, experience requirements, job requirements and labor market information. Occupations in the O*NET database are based on the [Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)](https://www.bls.gov/soc/) external site system. Visit the [O*NET-SOC Taxonomy](https://www.onetcenter.org/taxonomy.html) page to learn more.

## Additional Data Notes 
### Lower Living Standard Income Level Guidelines
The Lower Living Standard Income Level (LLSIL) reflects cost of living increases for the Regions and major metro areas by calculating the percentage change in the most recent Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for an area then applying this calculation to each of the previous year's LLSIL figures.

The USDOL/ETA’s [LLSIL Guidelines](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/llsil) include income charts that are used by state and local workforce investment areas to determine income eligibility for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs for youth and certain adult services, in addition to the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.
