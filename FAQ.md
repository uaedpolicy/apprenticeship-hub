## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is apprenticeship?
Apprenticeship is an industry-driven, high-quality career pathway where employers can develop and prepare their future workforce, and individuals can obtain paid work experience, classroom instruction, mentorship, and a portable credential. 

#### What is a registered apprenticeship? 
Registered Apprenticeship (RA) is a joint venture of a company or an intermediary acting on its behalf (e.g. – industry association) and the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) Office of Apprenticeship (OA) that develops registered and credentialed apprenticeship programs available to qualified employers for career development of their industry’s workforce.

#### What are the differences between industry-recognized apprenticeship programs and registered apprenticeship programs, and how do we determine which model to use?
IRAPs are high-quality apprenticeship programs recognized by industry and/or workforce leaders known as SREs. IRAPs were designed to give the additional flexibility necessary to expand the apprenticeship model and to address the diverse workforce needs of different industries and occupations. A RAP is a proven model of apprenticeship that has been validated by the Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Agency. RAPs are known for their structure, rigor, and quality and are designed for organizations interested in receiving the DOL or state seal of approval and funding opportunities made available by DOL. The U.S. Department of Labor has created a [helpful side-by-side document](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/employers/program-comparison) comparing the two programs.

#### How is apprenticeship different from other types of work-based training models?
Apprenticeship training is distinguished from other types of workplace training by several factors: (1) Apprenticeships are jobs! Apprentices earn wages from their employers during training; (2) Apprenticeship programs provide on-the-job learning and job-related classroom training; (3) On-the-job learning is conducted in the work setting under the direction of a mentor(s); and  (4) Training results in an industry-recognized and portable credential. 

#### What occupations are available for registered apprenticeships programs?
There are more than 2,000 approved occupations in the USDOL Office of Apprenticeship’s system.
